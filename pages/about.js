          Eat the Strip is a our humble tribute to the mom-and-pop food joints
          peppered across Ottawa suburbs. We feel the folks who run these
          restaurants, diners and bars don't get the credit they deserve. So, we
          created a restaurant review blog that only caters to strip mall gems.

        <p>
          For too long foodies with large social media followings and food
          bloggers have long overlooked these establishments, which tend to be
          tucked away in the periphery of the city. No, here you won't find any
          reviews or features of chain restaurants downtown. Here, it's a 100
          per cent strip malls.

          Strip mall: A retail complex consisting of stores or restaurants in
          adjacent spaces in one long building, typically having a narrow
          parking area directly in front of the stores.

          All reviews have been written by Ameya Charnalia, Danielle Jeffery and
          their friends. Eat the Strip was designed and developed by Ameya, an
          Ottawa-based Javascript developer, former parliamentary staffer and
          recovering journalist. We would like also like to thank Matt Dupont
          and Daniel Corner for their help and mentorship in building the
          website. Developers can see the source code, built in React and Next
