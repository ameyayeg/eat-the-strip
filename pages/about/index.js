          Eat the Strip is our tribute to the mom-and-pop food joints tucked
          into the suburbs of Ottawa-Gatineau and Fredericton. We believe the
          people behind these restaurants, diners, and bars donâ€™t get the
          recognition they deserve for shaping our local food culture. So we
          created a blog that shines a light exclusively on strip mall spots,
          industrial park eateries, and other hidden gems. ðŸ§¡
        </h2>
        <p>
          For too long, social media foodies and bloggers have overlooked these
          spotsâ€”often tucked away on the edges of the city. You wonâ€™t find
          reviews of downtown chain restaurants here. This blog is (almost)
          entirely dedicated to strip malls.

          Strip mall: A retail complex consisting of stores or restaurants in
          adjacent spaces in one long building, typically having a narrow
          parking area directly in front of the stores.

          Eat the Strip is designed, developed, and maintained by Ameya
          Charnalia. The site wouldnâ€™t have been possible without the technical
          mentorship of developers Brian Tavares, Mat Dupont, and Daniel Corner,
          as well as the support of Sergio Gonzalezâ€”who also gave the site its
          name. Developers can check out the source code, built with Next.js and
