Tucked away in the corner unit of a strip mall near South Keys train station, and next to Sona the Indian Kitchen, Cheese and Olives offers a warm, authentic taste of Palestine, with dishes that reflect the passion and dedication of owner Raed Alqedra.

On a rainy March afternoon, I found myself in this cozy space with towering ceilings and warm olive green walls, patiently awaiting the arrival of my meal. The atmosphere was inviting, the smooth piano music playing softly in the background, and the space, though empty between lunch and dinner, felt like it could easily host a bustling crowd of families enjoying a meal together.

Raed Alqedra, who opened this establishment only two months ago, had me immediately charmed with his larger-than-life personality. Originally from Gaza, Raed’s journey to Ottawa is as colourful as his food. He’s a man of many stories—one of which includes being the first person in Ottawa to legally BBQ on charcoal—and he’s determined to bring a taste of home to the capital. His latest venture, Cheese and Olives, reflects that mission, offering an authentic Palestinian experience that is both simple and comforting.

I began my meal with the cheese and olive fatayer, a traditional flat pie that’s as comforting as it is delicious. The golden, flaky crust was packed with a savoury blend of melted cheese, olives, and herbs. The cheese was wonderfully gooey, salty, and rich, providing the perfect bite alongside the olives, which added a slight briny contrast. The black sesame sprinkled on top gave the dish a lovely finishing touch. It’s the kind of food that makes you feel at home, even if you're far from it. The cheese, I’m told, is specially sourced for the restaurant, and you can taste the quality in every bite.

Raed tells me his goal is to serve home-cooked food like what his mother would make—a sentiment I quickly came to understand with every dish. As I savoured the fatayer, I noticed the incredible attention to detail. From the fresh ingredients to the perfect ratio of cheese and olives, this dish was an ideal introduction to the flavours of Palestine.

The hummus I tried next was equally impressive. It was smooth, creamy, and rich with garlic, but it was the olive oil that truly made it shine. Raed’s decision to use the highest-quality olive oil available paid off, adding a velvety depth to the hummus that set it apart from the usual. It was a simple dish, but one done so well that it made me rethink every hummus I’d had before.

To finish, I took home an order of kunafa, a dessert that combines delicate cheese with a touch of sweetness. While I didn’t have the chance to enjoy it fresh, reheating it brought out all the wonderful flavours—cheese oozing out from between the layers of sweet pastry, creating a satisfying balance that wasn’t overwhelmingly sweet, but just right.

With an average rating of 4.8 stars on Google, Cheese and Olives has already made a name for itself, and it’s easy to see why. Raed’s commitment to authenticity and freshness shines through in everything he serves. Whether you're a regular or a newcomer, this is a place that offers both comfort and community, with every dish made from the heart.

At around $40 for three generous dishes, including leftovers for a second meal, I left feeling more than satisfied. The food is fresh, the atmosphere relaxed, and Raed’s passion for his craft infectious. I’ll certainly be back for more—next time, I’m going for the falafel.
