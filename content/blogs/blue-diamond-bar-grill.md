In the heart of Richmond, Blue Diamond Bar & Grill blends the best of both worlds: a family-friendly sports bar and a bustling small-town breakfast joint, all while serving up authentic Punjabi cuisine. 

Located in an unassuming strip mall, the restaurant immediately grabs your attention with its vibrant purple walls and the inviting aroma of Indian spices that fill the air. As you step inside, it’s clear this isn’t just another neighbourhood pub. The mix of sports bar energy—complete with Sunday football on six screens—and the unmistakable warmth of a family-run business gives the place a unique, welcoming vibe. Saj, the son who runs the restaurant with his parents, greets each regular with a friendly word, contributing to the sense that this is as much a community gathering spot as it is a place to enjoy a meal.

Despite its dive-bar exterior, the food is a standout. The menu, a blend of Canadian pub favourites and Punjabi comfort food, offers something for everyone. As I flipped through the options, it was the traditional Indian dishes that caught my eye—especially sarson ka saag, a wintertime classic from Punjab. I couldn’t resist trying it. When the dish arrived, it was everything I hoped for: spicy, creamy, and full of depth. The mustard greens were cooked to perfection, delivering a mustardy, slightly tangy kick, and paired beautifully with tandoori roti. 

While Blue Diamond serves up familiar pub staples like burgers and wraps, the Punjabi dishes are what truly set it apart. Saj’s mother, who runs the kitchen, is behind every flavourful plate, and her expertise is evident in each bite. The restaurant, which opened in 2017, has grown in popularity thanks to word-of-mouth alone. Saj notes that while there’s been zero marketing, the restaurant’s authentic, home-style cooking and community feel have made it a favourite for locals—especially for breakfast, which is always bustling with families and early risers.

For those new to the menu, the butter chicken mac and cheese is a popular choice, combining Canadian comfort with Indian flavours. But it’s the traditional Punjabi dishes, like sarson ka saag, that truly shine.

While $30 per person is slightly higher than the typical fare at local strip mall joints, the authenticity of Blue Diamond’s food makes it worth every cent. The combination of hearty, flavour-packed dishes, chilled beer, and a warm, family-friendly atmosphere makes this Richmond spot one worth seeking out—whether you’re craving a post-game snack or a comforting Indian meal with a side of local charm.
