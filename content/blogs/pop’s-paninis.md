Tucked into a quiet Carling strip mall, Pop’s Paninis brings serious sandwich craft to an otherwise unassuming corner of Ottawa’s west end.

Pop’s is the kind of spot that feels like it was built on lunch breaks and word-of-mouth. According to manager Caitlin, they’ve been “really busy”—a fact made obvious by the steady lunch-hour stream from nearby businesses, including a loyal dental office crew who come by on the regular. That loyal customer base might have something to do with the charming extras: a crisp coleslaw, a fresh-baked cookie, and a panini built like someone actually cares what your lunch tastes like.

Opened in 2019 by Steven—aka “Pop”—the restaurant traces its origins back to the owner’s childhood sandwich experiments, refined over years of feeding his own kids before taking the leap to open a proper shop. Today, Pop’s Paninis operates two locations: this one, just off Woodroffe near Carling, and another out in Gloucester.

You can tell there's a good team vibe here. Caitlin mentions their active TikTok account, where they post some “silly stuff,” and a ten-second timer challenge that lets customers try their luck at winning a free sandwich. There's even a working vintage rotary phone in the corner that, yes, actually makes calls.

But none of the charm would matter if the paninis didn’t deliver—and they really do.

We went for the turkey brie panini, a house favourite that leans more deli-chic than fast-casual. The roasted turkey is legit: thick-cut, tender, and freshly prepped, not the pre-sliced stuff you’d expect at this price point. Brie melts down into creamy corners, playing nicely with tart slices of apple tucked inside. The bread hits that perfect balance—crisp on the outside, soft on the inside—and holds everything together without going soggy. It’s rich without being heavy, and flavourful without drowning in sauce.

At $16, it’s a little steep for a sandwich—but you’re paying for quality. And with the sides included, plus the warm welcome, it still feels like good value in today’s lunch economy.

Pop’s may be tucked away, but it's no secret anymore. Awards line the counter, and thanks to some smart social media moves, those lunch rush spikes are getting bigger by the week. It’s the kind of place that rewards your curiosity with a well-made meal, and then a cookie for the road.
