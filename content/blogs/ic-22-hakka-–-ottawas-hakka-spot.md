In the old La Cabana spot on Merivale, IC 22 is quietly setting the stage for Ottawa’s most electric Hakka experience yet.

No dine-in just yet—just a bold new sign, a fresh coat of ambition, and a takeout counter where co-owner Navneet Shetty is fielding questions with the same energy that pulses through his kitchen. He’s joined by Siddharth Phuria, and together they’ve brought Hakka food—a beloved Indo-Chinese hybrid cuisine—to a corner of Ottawa that’s been waiting for just this kind of fire.

If you’re unfamiliar, think of Hakka as the rowdy, spice-packed lovechild of Indian and Southern Chinese flavours. It’s noodles and fried rice doused in soy, garlic, green chilli, and masala. It’s crispy, saucy, and made for nights with beer and friends. It’s the kind of food that unapologetically owns its fusion roots—and if you grew up in Delhi like I did, it’s also comfort food through and through.

IC 22’s roots trace back to a commercial kitchen in Kanata. The response? Immediate and enthusiastic. “Every customer who visited was excited because it’s Hakka,” Navneet tells me. That momentum carried them to Merivale in April, where they took over the former La Cabana space—a longtime favourite of this blog that has since relocated to Holland Avenue. The vibe at IC 22 is no-frills but promising. A sign behind the counter. A kitchen humming with heat and spice. You can feel the place is just on the brink of coming to life.

I order a plate of Hakka noodles and chilli chicken. The noodles are excellent—savoury, spicy, a little smoky—and take me right back to the Friday nights of my childhood. In Delhi, that meant roadside Hakka joints, movie night with my mom, and noodles that somehow always tasted better out of foil containers than they did off a plate.

The chilli chicken delivers on flavour. The sauce hits with garlic, fennel, and just the right amount of heat. The chicken, though, has lost a bit of its crispiness by the time I dig in—takeout will do that. My advice? Don’t wait. Eat it while it’s still piping hot. These are flavours meant to be devoured fresh and bold, not politely reheated in a microwave.

IC 22 isn’t just about nostalgia—it’s also a bit of a tease. The space is clearly being prepped for something more. Tables and chairs arrive next week. And I’ll say it now: this should be a solid boozer. The cuisine begs for beer. Spicy, loud, perfect-for-sharing food needs a cold one to go with it, and once they get their alcohol licence in a few months, I fully expect this place to hit a new stride.

The popping flavours, intense spice, and visceral desire to have a cold one along with the food meant this spot hit all the right places. The only change I’d make is to try the food while it’s hot and fresh—and it seems like you’ll be able to do so once they have their tables and chairs in place next week. And if you’re like me and can’t wait to hit it up this week itself, try to grab a bench at a park nearby and chow it down while it’s still hot and crispy. Ain’t nothing worse than some soggy chilli chicken.
