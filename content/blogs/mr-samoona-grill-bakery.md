If you're ever driving down Bank Street and find yourself drawn to the tantalizing smell of sizzling meat and spices, follow your nose to Samoona. Nestled in a strip mall near Billings Bridge, this small but cozy Iraqi eatery has been quietly winning over food lovers since opening two years ago. Though it’s easy to miss at first, a stop here is more than worth it—especially if you're craving fresh, flavourful kebabs, creamy hummus, and homemade flatbreads.

Stepping inside Samoona feels like entering a warm, welcoming kitchen. The interior is small, with room for just 10 diners, but the atmosphere is cozy and inviting. One of the highlights is a vibrant mural depicting iconic Iraqi mosques. The space is simple but meaningful, with a mix of bright colours and earthy tones. Behind the counter, two servers work in sync, preparing orders for both dine-in customers and the constant stream of takeout regulars.

What makes Samoona stand out, however, is the open grill at the back of the restaurant, where skewers of tender, spiced meat and onions sizzle over a live fire. The aroma that fills the air is enough to make you hungry even if you weren't before. I was lucky enough to chat with Ahmed, one of the servers, who shared that his cousin, Firas, owns the restaurant. The place has built a loyal following, with many customers returning for the same satisfying meal.

After about 15 minutes, my kabab platter arrived—a delicious combination of two perfectly cooked skewers of minced meat and onions, lightly spiced and topped with sumac. The meat was juicy and tender, a contrast to the crunchy grilled vegetables. The dish is served with a generous portion of soft, warm flatbread, including the signature samoon—puffy, golden, and topped with sesame seeds. It’s the ideal vessel for scooping up the creamy hummus and a zingy garlic sauce that accompanies the meal.

For just $15, this meal was both filling and flavourful—an absolute steal. The balance of spices, the freshness of the bread, and the richness of the grilled meat made for a meal that was as comforting as it was delicious. Ahmed recommended I try the falafel next time, explaining that their version is quite different from the varieties typically found in other Arab countries. I’m intrigued to see what makes it stand out.

Though Samoona may be small in size, its impact is big. Whether you're grabbing takeout or dining in, this place is a must-try for anyone looking to explore authentic Iraqi flavours. The kebabs, the breads, and the dips all come together for a meal that’s not just satisfying, but also a reminder of how great food can transport you to another place.
