Tucked into a quiet stretch of a south-end strip mall that’s already gifted us Mr.Kabab and Egyptian Corner, Yemeni Gate makes its presence known before we even cross the threshold. The scent of cinnamon hangs in the air outside—earthy, sweet, and unmistakable. Inside, the space is clean and bright. Light from the long summer evening spills through wide windows, catching on black marble trim and bouncing softly across five or six neatly spaced tables. A bar-style counter runs the length of the front window, dotted with high chairs and diners quietly pulling tender meat from bone with their hands.

It’s 7:30 p.m. on a Monday night, and every seat is full. We’re here with our friend Faisal. Around us, groups of men laugh and talk over massive platters of rice and meat. Arabic music flows gently from a speaker tucked somewhere near the ceiling. The smell of spices—grill smoke, slow-cooked meat, clove—mingles with the buzz of conversation. It’s warm, familiar, and inviting.

We start with the tabeekh, a spiced vegetable soup that lands on the table steaming and slightly fiery. It's brothy and comforting, with a slow-building heat that’s perfect for cooler nights.

But the real reason we’re here is the mandi—Yemen’s signature rice and meat dish. The three of us agree on a small family platter of the mixed mandi, which gives us both lamb and chicken for around $45. It’s an incredible value: three people eat very well, with leftovers to spare.

When the plate arrives, it’s enormous. A full bed of basmati rice is crowned with golden strands of crispy fried onion, scattered almonds, sweet fried raisins, and—taking centre stage—fall-apart lamb and gently charred chicken. The first bite confirms what the scent already promised: this is food made with time and care. The lamb falls apart under a fork, all tenderness and deep flavour. It’s juicy without being greasy, intensely seasoned without overpowering the natural richness of the meat.

The chicken is its own kind of triumph. Often overshadowed by lamb in dishes like these, here it holds its own—marinated, moist, and touched with just the right amount of smoke. The rice beneath it all is a tapestry of flavour: every grain cooked through and gently spiced, with just enough oil to carry the flavour but not so much as to feel heavy.

Faisal tells us that this spice blend is either the traditional mandi mix or a close cousin—homemade, he says, and clearly made with a careful hand. It’s comforting but complex: cardamom, clove, cinnamon, and maybe something floral, softened together into something more than the sum of its parts.

After the meal, we speak with Sami, whose family owns the restaurant. He’s soft-spoken, friendly, and clearly proud of what Yemeni Gate has built since opening in July 2022. “We’ve had restaurants in Saudi, in Yemen, even in Malaysia,” he tells us. “So the spices have always been the same.” His family is from Ibb, a green city in southwestern Yemen known for its food and hospitality. It shows here.

“The lamb is fresh,” he adds. “We cook it the very next day. It’s expensive, but that’s how we do it at home.”

That word—home—comes up often. And it makes sense. Everything about Yemeni Gate feels like a tether to something older: a way of cooking and eating that isn’t chasing trends or gimmicks, but simply recreating a familiar table from far away. “Each restaurant has its own special mandi,” Sami says. “This one is ours.”

For first-timers, he recommends starting with the mandi. For those more familiar, the haneeth, another slow-cooked meat dish, is worth trying next. And the future? “We want to go bigger,” he says. “We want Yemeni food to be known by more Canadians.”

We hope they get there. For now, Yemeni Gate is quietly doing something special in a corner of a strip mall that continues to surprise us. It’s a reminder—once again—that the best food in the city isn’t always front and centre. Sometimes, it’s tucked between a dry cleaner and a vape shop, steeped in spice, and waiting to welcome you in.
