Just a few doors down from last week’s stop at Mr. Kabab, another culinary secret is quietly making its mark in this south-end strip mall. Egyptian Corner is exactly the kind of place we love to feature: modest, family-run, and serving food that doesn’t need a PR campaign to prove its worth. The smell alone is all the marketing it needs.

Inside, the space is sparse. A few small tables line the walls, with framed portraits of pharaohs and ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs lending a little personality to the otherwise simple décor. A fridge by the door is stocked with cold drinks, and the kitchen is mostly hidden behind a sliding door—except for a gap through which I can see into the back, where fresh vegetables are being chopped and plated dishes are hustled out.

I’m greeted by a smiling man at the counter who introduces himself as Mohamed Sarhan, the owner. I tell him I’m here to try the koshari and a falafel sandwich with lots of vegetables. He nods and disappears into the kitchen. As I wait, I take in the menu taped to the kitchen door—nothing fancy, just paper and tape—but the dishes listed are pure Egyptian street food: foul, moussaka, koshari, and more. Not a single item cracks the $14 mark, and most hover closer to ten.

The koshari comes first, hot and hefty despite being labelled a “small.” It’s a carb-lover’s dream: layers of macaroni, vermicelli noodles, lentils, and chickpeas all pulled together with a rich, tomato-based sauce. But what sets it apart are the fried onions—generously piled on top, they add a smoky crunch that cuts through the softness of everything underneath. The koshari comes with two house-made sauces: a tart vinaigrette that brightens each bite, and a fiery Egyptian hot sauce called daqqa, which lends a creeping heat that builds pleasantly as you go.

Then there’s the falafel sandwich. I’ll say it straight: this might be my favourite sandwich I’ve eaten on the blog so far. The falafel itself is a revelation—fluffy on the inside, crispy on the outside—and it’s made in the Egyptian style, with fava beans instead of chickpeas. It’s nestled into a soft pita with fresh vegetables, grilled eggplant, and, brilliantly, potato chips. The whole thing is layered like a street food love letter from Cairo. At $7, it feels like I’ve gotten away with something.

Mohamed’s wife is chopping fresh vegetables in the background as he checks in to see if I need anything else. The couple work quietly and efficiently behind the counter, clearly comfortable in the rhythm of their small operation. “This is a family business,” Mohamed tells me. “We used to run a food truck before, but our customers told us to open a restaurant.” So they did, earlier this year.

Everything here is made to taste like home—literally. Mohamed tells me they try to imitate the recipes exactly as they’re made back in Egypt. That authenticity shows in every bite.

“This is for everyone,” Mohamed says, smiling. “Not just people who know Egyptian food. Everyone likes it once they try.”

There’s something deeply satisfying about finding places like Egyptian Corner. It’s the kind of restaurant where flavour doesn’t follow trends, where dishes aren’t fussed over, and where the goal is simple: make good food, keep it affordable, and treat people well. Around Bank and Heron, places like this are quietly thriving—and they deserve more attention.

I left with a full stomach, a newfound love for Egyptian falafel, and the certainty that I’ll be back soon. Probably very soon.
