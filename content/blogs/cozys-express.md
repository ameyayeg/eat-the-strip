I’m not the first to crave an old-fashioned breakfast after a late night out, nor will I be the last. Fortunately, there are plenty of Eat the Strip readers who recommend strip-mall eateries that rise to the occasion. 

Last Saturday, I was perusing through our database and noticed a breakfast spot suggested by Eat the Strip reader Nicholas Swandel: Cozy’s Express. A quick Google search told me it was in the same industrial park in southeast Ottawa that featured legendary breakfast spots such as Mona’s Café and Restaurant.

Industrial parks tend to be a goldmine for delicious food. Cozy’s Express seemed promising.

I hopped on my trusty e-scooter and made the journey east. I rode past the auto shops and factories after crossing St. Laurent Boulevard. knew I was close because I could smell the eggs and bacon in the air. I took a right onto Michael Street and saw the restaurant’s green sign. 

Famished after a long ride, I was greeted inside by the cheerful and welcoming Amberlea, a server who gave me a menu and allowed me to plug my scooter into the wall to charge. 

Sana, the owner, recommended I get the house special number one, which comes with two eggs, toast, sausages, bacon, ham and home fries. She even tossed in a third egg for free.

The eggs, done over-easy, were perfectly seasoned. The bacon was crispy and the gregarious Amberlea didn’t let my coffee mug ever sit empty. The toast, generously slathered in butter, was warm and crispy on the edges and soft in the middle.

For the next 10 minutes, I didn’t share a word. I tucked into breakfast platter, eating like a king, for cheap, with unlimited refills of coffee—a true hallmark of a proper greasy spoon. 

Don’t be fooled by the unpretentious exterior or the license places that adorn the walls that can make Cozy Express look like a truck stop. This is part of the charm. 

I could see why truckers and other workers pour into Cozy’s Express bright and early. 

The hearty fare hits the spot without a hit to the wallet, with my total coming to $17.20 only.

Next time you’re having a hankering for breakfast, go check out Cozy’s Express. You’ll come back home with fond memories and a happy belly.
