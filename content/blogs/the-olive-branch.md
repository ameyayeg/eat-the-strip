Manotick may feel like the boonies to some, but it’s home to a few hidden gems that are well worth the drive. Tucked in a humble strip mall between a weed shop and an indie grocery store is The Olive Branch, a cozy spot that proves you don’t need to be in the city centre to serve up fantastic food.

I arrived on a chilly February afternoon, driving through Manotick’s picturesque main street lined with quirky shops and nostalgic small-town vibes. The strip mall is easy to miss, but it’s well worth the stop. I walked in, greeted immediately by the server, who promptly led me to a seat by the window where the light streamed in, warming me up from the cold. The place has the feel of a neighbourhood restaurant—casual, friendly, and super welcoming. You’ll notice the 2024 Ottawa Awards plaque on the wall when you step inside, a quiet testament to the quality of this hidden gem.

Owner Andreas Fountotos, who’s been in the restaurant biz for over 20 years, always dreamed of opening a Greek restaurant that not only served delicious food but also brought a sense of community together. His passion for Greek cuisine is clear. You can really taste the care in the food, thanks in part to Andreas’s commitment to using ingredients imported straight from Greece—olive oil, spices, and more.

The menu boasts some serious hits, but I decided to go with the keftedes platter, a dish that’s hard to ignore once you know what’s on it. Within about 15 minutes, the dish arrived, accompanied by the warm, rhythmic pulse of catchy Greek music setting the tone. Let’s talk food: the fries were drizzled with a zesty garlic vinaigrette that’s just too good—tangy, fresh, and honestly the perfect match for the crispy golden fries.

The keftedes, juicy little beef patties lightly spiced with oregano and dill, came hot off the grill. Paired with tzatziki that’s refreshingly cool and smooth, they were just what I needed to escape the frigid Ottawa winter. And the long-grain rice? Soaked in meat juices and vinaigrette, it was a satisfying mouthful with every bite. I took a moment to savour the fresh salad that accompanied the meal—crunchy cucumbers, onions, and feta tossed in olive oil and lemon. Simple ingredients, done right.

Jonny Lopez, the restaurant’s manager, shared a little behind-the-scenes magic with me. He and Andreas have been running The Olive Branch together for three years now, and their dedication to fresh, authentic food shines through. Jonny’s had his time working at a Michelin-star restaurant in the UK, so he knows a thing or two about quality ingredients, and they bring that level of precision to everything they do here. Every single dish is made to order; nothing is pre-made or frozen. It’s all about authenticity. No shortcuts.

And it shows. The Olive Branch has earned an average of 4.9 stars on Google at the time of writing, a testament to the care they put into every dish. Jonny said they’re looking to expand soon, but they want to take their time to ensure the restaurant is fully established before they take that leap.

But here’s the thing: The Olive Branch is already doing it right. It’s the kind of place where you feel like you’re getting a home-cooked meal with a level of quality that you might expect from a much bigger, more established spot—only it’s tucked away in the unassuming charm of a strip mall in Manotick. Whether you’re craving a hearty platter or just a quiet meal in a comfortable spot, this place has got you covered. 

A platter will set you back just over $30 but I had enough leftovers to make two meals of it. So, the next time you find yourself driving through Manotick, don’t skip over this strip mall gem. The Olive Branch is one of those spots you’ll want to visit again and again. And trust me, once you’ve had those fries and keftedes, you’ll know exactly what I mean.
