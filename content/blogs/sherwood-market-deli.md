Imagine walking into a small convenience store and seeing a lineup snaking around the aisles, leading up to a deli counter at the back.

If your first instinct would be to join the line to see what magic lies at the end, that’s exactly what I did the first time I went to Sherwood Market & Deli. That’s how I discovered their fabled barbecue chicken, bacon and avocado sandwich. Since then, my partner and co-writer of Eat the Strip Danielle and I have visited several times, never straying from that very order.

The sandwich is legendary. A quick glance at Sherwood’s Google reviews reveals hundreds of reviews praising the sandwich, their fresh ingredients and great service. People praised the prices too, with the signature chicken, bacon and avocado sandwich costing $8 per sandwich—a price that’s hard to beat for the sheer portion you receive.

I popped into Sherwood on a Thursday, around lunchtime. Around a dozen people were already in line, patiently placing their orders with the four employees behind the counter. Two employees were preparing the sandwiches, while the other two bagged them and stocked ingredients. On a sizeable counter sat a large container containing Sherwood’s signature slice egg bread. Deserts line the shelf near the checkout, tempting hungry customers with their reasonably priced Nanaimo bars, costing $2.69 each.

Outside is a parking lot that, naturally, fills up around lunchtime. Several construction employees grab their sandwiches and eat at a picnic table on the grass at the edge of the parking lot, under the cool shade of a tree. I grab my sandwiches, pay and head out, thinking about all the people who probably drive past the store’s ordinary façade without knowing there’s a deli inside serving up some of the best sandwiches in Ottawa.

Sherwood serves all their sandwiches in a bag that keeps the food fresh—one of the several little things they do that elevate their appeal. At home, I bite into my sandwich, getting a mouthful of the brioche-like bread, crispy bacon and the fresh avocado. This is probably the quintessential blue collar Ottawa sandwich. After serving sandwiches for nearly 25 years, Sherwood has perfected their craft. I understood why folks working in construction line up for their sandwiches. They’re cheap, nutritious and filling. 

And the barbecue, chicken and avocado sandwich is king.
