Nestled beside a Tim Hortons on Carling Avenue, Namaste Ottawa offers a taste of the unexpected, bringing the bold flavours of Bihar to the city.

Walking into Namaste Ottawa, the inviting scent of spices immediately wraps around you, preparing your taste buds for a true culinary adventure. The minimalist design of the space is clean and welcoming, with booths lining the walls, offering a comfortable place to settle in. Images of iconic Indian landmarks like the Taj Mahal add a touch of tradition, while the televisions above the counter showcase dishes from across the Indian subcontinent, setting the stage for what’s to come.

What sets Namaste Ottawa apart is its dedication to authenticity, led by chef Pradip Kumar Jha, whose decades of experience have helped bring the flavours of eastern India’s Bihar region to Ottawa’s dining scene. A seasoned chef who’s spent over 20 years travelling and perfecting the art of traditional Indian cuisine, Prakash offers a menu that spans the entire Indian subcontinent, from north to south. But it’s the Bihari dishes that steal the show, especially the Champaran-style mutton curry, a hearty, rich dish that draws you in with its deep, complex flavours.

I decide to go for the mutton curry, served alongside two warm tawa rotis. As soon as it arrives, the fire-red curry, topped with fresh cilantro, beckons me to dig in. The tender goat meat falls off the bone effortlessly, its rich, smoky heat perfectly balanced with the distinct mustard oil flavour — a signature of Bihari cooking. The spicing is complex, with hints of clove and chili, adding depth and warmth that linger. Each bite feels like a journey into the heart of Bihar, and the rotis, perfectly buttery and crisp, are the ideal vessel to scoop up the delicious curry.

Namaste Ottawa’s commitment to quality is evident in every dish, from the freshly made rotis to the carefully selected ingredients. Co-owner Laheri Trivedi, originally from Gujarat, works alongside Prakash to ensure that every meal served is a reflection of their passion for authentic Indian food. Since opening in November 2024, the response has been positive, with locals flocking to try dishes like the chicken lollipop and the mutton curry. The restaurant prides itself on offering exceptional food without the hefty price tag, with most menu items priced between $10 to $25, making it an affordable option for those seeking a real taste of India. My meal, which included the mutton curry and two rotis, came to a reasonable $22 — a great value considering the portion size and the quality of the food.

As I finish my meal, satisfied and eager to return, I realize that Namaste Ottawa is yet another shining example of why Ottawa’s industrial parks and strip malls often hold the best culinary surprises. With a talented chef like Prakash at the helm, Namaste Ottawa is truly a destination worth discovering for those seeking real, bold Indian flavours.
