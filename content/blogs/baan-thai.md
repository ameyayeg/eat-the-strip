A journey west can often lead you east.

We took Baseline Road west from our Carlington apartment to Baan Thai, described on Google as a “snug spot with a cheery vibe offering standard Thai fare, including noodles, seafood and curries.”

Tucked away in a strip mall in the heart of Centrepointe, Baan Thai has been a neighbourhood staple for well over a decade. A framed Ottawa Citizen article singing the restaurant’s praises greets you as walk in. Families from the neighbourhood—and further afield—chat away at dinnertime, as the smell of lemongrass wafts from the kitchen. 

We were greeted by a polite server who recommended the spicy green curry, known in Thai as kaeng khiao wan. 

It was decided—we’d get the curry and the shrimp pad thai. 

Both arrived within 10 minutes. We dug into the noodles first. The portions of shrimp were generous, the vegetables fresh and the egg bits were a welcome addition. The noodles had a hint of spice, which was tempered by the sweet peanut sauce.

Being a little too sweet for my liking, I moved to the green curry.

It quickly became the standout dish. The thin strips of chicken were perfectly cooked and imbued with lemongrass and a hint of spice from thai chillies. The coconut milk-based gravy was rich and imparted a delicious flavour to the crunchy bamboo shoots and bell peppers. It was perfectly cooked. What’s more is that had leftovers to take home for lunch the next day.

Word to the wise: most curries tend to taste even better when heated up the day after. This was true of the green curry. 

The generous portions—and reasonable prices, with our bill coming to just over $40—meant we had enough for both the next day. With its enticing menu and cozy ambiance, we’ll certainly be back to Baan Thai soon.
