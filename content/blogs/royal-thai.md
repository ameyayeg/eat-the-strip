OÔªøttawa might have a plethora of solid Thai restaurants, but this new one opened by the same couple that owns Sergio's Tacquiera might just be the best.

YÔªøou can't go wrong with any item on the menu. Their signature green curry is delightfully spicy and their desserts are delicious.

MÔªøake sure to try the buffet spread before you leave. It's delicious.
