If you live in Carlington, you may have noticed the scent of something delicious lingering at the corner of Shillington Avenue and Hollington Street.

You don’t have to venture too far from there to see that Run2Patty—a family-owned Jamaican restaurant serving up delicious island fare such as oxtail patties, goat curry and jerk chicken—is hitting all the right notes. 

This unpretentious takeout-only joint is not just our go-to spot for Caribbean food, it’s also one of my favourite spots in the city. It was only a matter of time before it made an appearance on Eat the Strip. 

My eyes immediately drift to the menu’s vast selection of patties each time I visit the restaurant. We recently ordered oxtail and beef patties and the shrimp po' boy platter.

The po' boy’s battered, crispy shrimp comes nestled in a bun with coleslaw, topped with a house made remoulade sauce, served with macaroni salad and fries.

The jumbo shrimp was perfectly fried, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. It was drizzled in a generous portion of remoulade sauce. The bread was freshly baked, featuring a crispy crust and fluffy centre.

Run2Patty was founded by Jacob Henry, a graduate from the culinary management program at Algonquin College. He started out by making fresh Jamaican beef patties but has since branched out to a menu featuring eight different types of patties.

With their flaky exterior and spicy filling, their classic beef patties remain my favourite. But a close second is their oxtail patty. The Jamaican curry spice blend coupled with the heat from the peppers is great way to break a sweat. It couples perfectly with a cold, fizzy beverage. (Word to the wise: try making it to the restaurant early for oxtail patties as they tend to go fast.)

Moreover, you won’t have to break the bank as patties range from $2.25 to $3.25 per piece.

Run2Patty’s website says their food uses “authentic spices that take you all the way back to your granny’s kitchen.”

Their hearty food, warm reception and generous portions certainly took me back to mine.
