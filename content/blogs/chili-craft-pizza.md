Saturdays in our household are busy. More so after running a six kilometre mud race. 

That’s when cravings for some good strip mall food begin. But first, let me back up a little. 

While there are no little ones in our household who need to be fed or pets that need to be walked, we tend to fill our weekends with outings with friends, calls to family and productive escapades that leave us with stories to tell and memories to last a lifetime.  

This particular Saturday was no exception. 

We started the morning early, rising at about 8:00 a.m. to brew some coffee. The long drive was marked by hip hop throwbacks. Nelly’s classic hits got us amped up to do the run. (Most of it was walked, but the important thing is that it was fun and muddy.) 

After our outing with all the obstacles, mud, and many sore muscles, we contemplated melting into our comfy couch. But our friend had just gotten a new puppy she wanted us to meet. How could we say no? So, we dragged ourselves from the comfy homestead and headed out to meet Virgina Woof—also known as Gina—the red golden retriever.  

After a solid couple of hours of puppy playtime—and a six kilometre run thrown in for good measure—you can imagine we were pretty hungry. 

Cue the Eat the Strip strip mall adventure. 

We found Chili Craft Pizza tucked away in a strip mall just off Carling Avenue, near Bayshore. 

The menu seemed to cater to many palates, from classic pizzas to new creations with extensive, inspired toppings and range of vegetarian options that looked delicious, even to us meat eaters. Always feeling nostalgic for the flavours of India, we settled on a tandoori chicken pizza and a tandoori chicken wrap. 

We enjoyed the pizza and found the flavors of a slightly sweet madras sauce, green pepper, onion and tandoori chicken to resemble an Indian/Canadian crossover. It would satisfy even those not specifically seeking desi flavours. The toppings worked well and the chipotle mayo was an added bonus.

While the pizza was good, there are other desi pizza joints in the city we prefer. A medium pizza set us back $20.99 before taxes. The tandoori chicken wrap, on the other hand, was what made this outing worth it. 

I can’t rave about enough about it; so creamy, saucy, flavorful, and packed with mouth-watering tandoori chicken. We couldn’t put this one down.

While Chili Craft Pizza doesn’t offer seating and is mainly a take-out location, the proximity to Britannia Beach makes it a great stop on the way to your next park outing or for a movie night at home.  

If you go, make sure not to miss out on their excellent desi wraps. At $11.99, they’re affordable, filling and pack some delicious flavour.
