You wouldn’t know it was there unless you happened to get lost behind the old Chatham Hall, tucked off Forest Hill Road in Skyline Acres. But turn past the bend and the brick apartments, and you’ll see it: a splash of orange on the front of an otherwise ordinary building. Inside, El Mariachi is spacious but warm—plastic-covered tables in all different colours, tabla lotería cards under the glass, and three TVs showing NCAA football like it's a Saturday in Guadalajara. A large Mexican flag hangs proudly at the front, in front of a fully stocked bar. Jorge Medina croons softly through the speakers. There’s no rush, no hustle. Just a sense that this place knows exactly what it’s doing.

It’s 5:30 p.m. and I’m flying solo. One other table is working through a big bowl of guacamole. Otto, my server, greets me with a smile and recommends the quesabirria and the fish tacos without hesitation. That’s what I came for anyway. I’d just left a backyard BBQ and wasn’t especially hungry—but there was no way I was skipping the michelada. It wasn’t on the menu, but when I asked, he smiled and said, “Of course.”

Both tacos arrive together, and they don’t hold back. The fish taco is a full handful—lightly battered fish stacked high on a bed of coleslaw that brings crunch and tang, topped with a chipotle sauce that sneaks in a slow, smoky heat. It’s bright, fresh, and sunny in all the right ways. The kind of dish that pulls you out of your chair and into the memory of some coastal breeze.

The quesabirria is the one you write home about. Crunchy on the outside, slow-cooked beef on the inside—rich, juicy, and falling apart with every bite. It’s got that magic balance of fat and acid, salt and spice. The cheese is molten, the cilantro and onion cut through it all like sunlight, and then there’s the consommé. I dunk the taco, watch the broth cling to the edge, and take another bite. It’s gooey, savoury, a little messy, and completely satisfying.

Then there’s the michelada. It arrives in a hand-painted clay mug, beaded with condensation. The rim is heavy with Tajín, the drink icy cold and red from Clamato and spice. One sip and I snap awake—lime, chili, beer, all pulling in different directions and somehow meeting perfectly in the middle. It’s tangy, it’s punchy, it’s alive. “It makes my entire body perk up,” I scribble in my notes, and I mean it. It’s one of the best I’ve had in the country.

I talk with Otto, who tells me people come from Moncton and Saint John just to eat here. “It’s the only authentic Mexican restaurant \[in town], because I have experienced it myself,” he says. “The chef cooks food for Mexicans that Canadians get to enjoy.” No shortcuts. No diluting flavours to make things more palatable. The ingredients come from Toronto—and they pay the shipping themselves.

And while prices could have followed the trend of watered-down “fusion” fare, they didn’t. Tacos are $6–7 each, and generously portioned. The michelada runs $12, which feels steep at first—until you taste it. Every bite and sip here is a reminder that they’re not phoning it in.

Carlos Alvarez, the owner and chef, is from Guerrero, Mexico. He opened El Mariachi in 2022 as a love letter to the food he grew up with. “One of the things I want to be known for is authentic Mexican food,” he says on the restaurant’s website. And that authenticity comes through in every detail—from the food, to the soundtrack, to the confidence of a place that doesn’t need to shout to be heard. Fredericton isn’t exactly swimming in Mexican food—but even if it were, El Mariachi would still stand out.

They could’ve coasted. They could’ve done half as well and still come out ahead, just by being different. But they don’t coast. They deliver.

And now, with a new northside location on the horizon, El Mariachi is doubling down. More tacos. More micheladas. More reasons to be glad this place exists.
