On a Friday at 4 pm, that quiet hour between lunch and dinner, we walked into Tomotachi Sushi at 1168 Smythe Street, tucked between a grocery store and a burger joint. From the outside, it’s unassuming. Inside, though, it’s all warm wood panelling, mellow pop music, and that cozy, lived-in feel that tells you a place has been loved rather than simply occupied. A green feature wall anchors one corner, comfortable booths line the space, and at the back you can watch the chefs carefully assembling rolls while the kitchen hums behind a curtain.

When we arrived there was just one occupied table and a steady trickle of takeout orders. By the time we left, nearly every seat was filled. Families, coworkers, and groups of friends filtered in, most of them ordering sushi. It felt like we had stumbled into the start of the dinner rush without even trying.

Kevin, the manager, came by to chat and told us the restaurant has been under new ownership for about two and a half years, though Tomotachi itself has been around for nearly a decade. Their focus since taking over has been freshness. “We try to soruce our fish fresh,” he told us, explaining that the chefs filet the fish themselves and put serious emphasis on ingredient quality, even if it means dishes take a little longer. When we asked what we should try, he didn’t hesitate: the salmon had been delivered the day before and should be at the top of our list.

We were sold.

Our server brought complimentary miso soup to start, a warm and savoury way to whet our appetites, alongside jasmine tea. About 20 minutes later, our sushi matsu and yaki noodles hit the table and we dug in immediately.

The salmon nigiri was almost buttery, extremely fresh, and uniquely delicate in flavour. Isa, who’s been to Japan, nodded approvingly at the texture — exactly as it should be. The California roll was a reminder that “Americanized” doesn’t mean inferior; the rice was well seasoned and sticky without being heavy, allowing the flavours to shine. Then there was the eel: rich with umami, almost grassy in its depth, buttery and beautifully paired with a dab of wasabi.

The yaki noodles were saucy in the best way. Crunchy vegetables balanced the softness of the noodles, and the grilled shrimp added a savoury bite. There were bits of sesame that gave a subtle nod to Korean influences. I loved the level of spice; Isa would have happily taken it up a notch, but we both agreed the sauce was a winner. We polished off the entire plate quickly, barely pausing between bites.

Now, we do have to talk about price. Compared to some of the sub-$20 strip mall gems we often feature, this meal came in at $65 before tip. It’s a noticeable jump. But with food inflation still hitting restaurants hard — and sushi being especially dependent on high-quality, fresh seafood — it’s not entirely surprising. When freshness is your priority, it shows up on the bill. It also shows up on the plate.

Kevin reflected on how many people in Western countries are first introduced to grocery store sushi, the pre-made trays that sit under bright lights. “It’s a night and day difference,” he said of freshly prepared sushi. The new owners, who are Korean, have kept their focus firmly on Japanese cuisine, aiming to offer flavours and quality comparable to what you’d find overseas. “The people here are super nice…for us the community itself they’re like the biggest reason why we’re able to keep a business here.”

That sense of care extended to our entire experience. Service was warm and attentive without being intrusive. The ambiance was relaxed and welcoming. And while it’s tempting to measure quality solely through authenticity — and dishes like the eel and nigiri certainly delivered on that front — doing so misses the point. The California roll was excellent. The noodles were comforting and bold. This meal was an explosion of flavour through simplicity, letting fresh ingredients do what they do best.

Yes, we left with our wallets a little lighter. But if you’re a fan of Japanese and Japanese-influenced cooking, Tomotachi Sushi is well worth the treat.
