In the quiet corner of a Kanata North strip mall, a small café named Luna Crepes & Café has been quietly building a devoted following among locals for 11 years, its warm presence marked by a playful vestibule sign that declares, "Dinosaurs didn't drink coffee and look how that turned out."

Behind this humble façade, owners Cigdem Gulen and her family have transformed what was once a struggling business into a beloved community hub, where 90 per cent of customers are loyal regulars and the staff knows their children's names as well as their preferred orders. The story of Luna is particularly remarkable - the owners, former television producers and medical professionals from Istanbul, fled Turkey for political reasons and chose to preserve the original name, determined to breathe new life into the establishment.

The café's commitment to authenticity extends to every aspect of their operation. Unlike most establishments, they cook exclusively with olive oil, crafting everything from scratch in a kitchen that blends Mediterranean influences from Italy, France, Greece, and Turkey. Their dedication to quality is matched only by their commitment to family - they maintain early closing hours of 4 p.m. to ensure staff can spend time with their loved ones, a decision that reflects their philosophy that "business is not just serving food and coffee."

During my late-afternoon visit, the café pulsed with gentle energy as sweet jazz music filled the air and three women worked diligently behind the counter. The atmosphere was distinctly cozy, with about a dozen comfortable tables and armchairs creating an inviting space that felt more like a neighbour's living room than a commercial establishment. Even as closing time approached, the door continued to welcome new visitors, though staff politely turned away those seeking anything other than drinks and desserts.

The pièce de résistance proved to be their tres leches cake, a masterpiece of balance and texture. The marble-topped caramel formed a perfectly gooey crust that adhered delightfully to my beard, while the cake itself maintained a delicate egg wash flavour beneath its generous soaking of three types of milk. Paired with a milky cappuccino, the total bill came to approximately $16 - perhaps slightly higher than average but entirely justified by the generous portion sizes and evident care in preparation.

As I departed, I caught sight of their patio area, adorned with a West Ottawa Business Excellence Award sticker from 2017, promising warmer days to come. Though the patio remained closed on this early March afternoon, Gulen's simple "soon" suggested that spring's arrival would bring new life to this already vibrant community space.
