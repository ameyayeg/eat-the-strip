It’s easy to overlook Polka Delicatessen, located in a strip mall between a cell phone repair shop and a make-your-own wine space. But step inside, and it’s clear this small, unassuming store has become a fixture for Ottawa’s Polish community—and for anyone craving a taste of authentic Eastern European deli fare.

The interior is modest but filled with character. Shelves are lined with imported goods, from chocolates and candies to jars of jams and grains. Murals of vibrant flowers decorate the walls, and the heart of the shop is the glass deli counter. Behind it, a no-nonsense team of women work quickly, slicing meats and assembling sandwiches as customers speak Polish among themselves, creating an unmistakable atmosphere of familiarity.

Owner Agnes Kozlowska opened Polka Delicatessen six years ago. Since then, the deli has steadily built a loyal following, most of whom are Polish expats. Still, despite the rising costs of ingredients, Agnes and her team try to keep prices affordable. Deli sandwiches, which began at $4.59, now sit at $6—a small increase for a generous portion.

I tried a turkey sandwich and a hunter sausage on my visit. The turkey, served on a thick kaiser roll, came with a healthy dollop of mayonnaise and mustard, along with a subtle sweetness from the pickles that balanced the flavours nicely. The sandwich was a satisfying meal in itself, filling without being overwhelming.

The standout, however, was the hunter sausage: dry, peppery, and rich with fat. Its dry texture reminded me of kubasa, but with a sharper, spiced finish. Paired with the fresh kaiser roll, it made for a simple yet hearty meal—exactly the kind of food you’d want to grab when you're in a rush but still craving something with depth.

There’s nothing flashy about Polka Delicatessen. It’s not trying to be a trendy hotspot. But it’s this straightforwardness—combined with the quality of the food—that makes it a hidden gem. While the deli’s location in a strip mall may not be immediately eye-catching, the loyal clientele and efficient service speak volumes about what’s on offer: authentic, flavour-packed sandwiches and an array of Polish meats and goods. If you're looking for something satisfying, quick, and deeply rooted in tradition, Polka Delicatessen delivers, no questions asked.
