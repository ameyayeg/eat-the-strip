Hidden in an industrial park, across from a winter snow dump, lies The Sandwich Stop - a culinary treasure that proves sometimes the best food comes from unexpected places.

Walking into this bustling takeout spot during lunch rush reveals a kitchen alive with activity. Three staff members work efficiently behind the counter while Ottawa Senators commentary plays on the radio, adding to the casual, welcoming atmosphere. A photo of Seinfeld's Soup Nazi adorns the wall, bringing a touch of whimsy to the industrial setting. The menu board features creative sandwich names like The Big Mouth and Manny's Sangwich, while staff wear black t-shirts emblazoned with the cheeky hashtag #nevertrustaskinnychef.

Owner Manny Mellios, who opened The Sandwich Stop in 2017, brings 45 years of restaurant experience to this modest location. Previously operating a 300-seat establishment in Bell's Corners, he made the deliberate choice to downscale to focus on personal connections with customers. "Do I miss the big store? Sure," he admits, "but I like this - it's a lot more personal." His brother joined him in the business venture, bringing their combined expertise to this intimate setting.

Despite describing his location as "the worst in the city of Ottawa," regulars flock here from across town. Customers drive from Kanata specifically to visit, with one enthusiast declaring it "the best part of my week." Manny takes pride in knowing people make the effort to seek out his shop, saying, "Everything we do, we make the sandwich for you. Every sandwich is personal."

The beef brisket sandwich exemplifies this commitment to quality. Available exclusively on Fridays, this specialty offering costs just over $16 - a premium price justified by the generous portion and exceptional quality. Cut in-house daily, the meat melts in your mouth with the richness reminiscent of Montreal smoked meat. Paired with caramelized onions and served on a crispy Kaiser roll, these massive portions easily serve as both lunch and dinner. As noted by my partner and co-writer of the blog Danielle, "you need four hands to lift the sandwiches" - a testament to the generous serving size.

Most of The Sandwich Stop's other creations come in at just over $10 each, representing excellent value for the generous portions and freshly prepared ingredients. While prices will increase next month due to unavoidable inflation pressures affecting everything from meat to lettuce, the current price point remains reasonable considering the homemade ingredients and substantial portion size. As Manny builds community through his craft, The Sandwich Stop stands as a prime example of why Ottawa's industrial parks deserve exploration - sometimes the best meals hide in plain sight, waiting to be discovered.
