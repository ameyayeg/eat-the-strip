I decided to stop by Misto Fine Food Shop on a recent visit to a nearby business.

The Italian grocery store and deli has been on our list of spots to review for a while, not least because we’ve had several readers ask us to go check them out. They’re also conveniently located in Hampton Park Plaza—where we tend to do our groceries.

We’re greeted at the family-owned store by owner Mario, who has been in the food business for over two decades. Prior to opening Misto, he worked as a chef at a prominent Ottawa restaurant. He greets me with a warm smile as I wait for my cajun deli chicken breast panini.

The deli has the familiar feel of a neighbourhood shop where regular customers and employees know each other on a first-name basis. Shelves are packed with items imported from Italy, with no shortage of extra virgin olive oil, pastas and sundried tomatoes. At the back there are a handful of small tables for people who want to eat their sandwich—or panini—while still warm. 

I chatted with one of the ladies working at the deli counter as she pressed my panini on a grill. She recognized Eat the Strip from our radio columns on CBC’s Ottawa Morning and smiled as she handed me my panini.

A generous portion of chicken breast paired well with the provolone, which was sharp but not too biting. The sundried tomatoes added a welcome, tart flavour. While other delis can sometimes douse their sandwiches in sauce, Misto’s panini was in perfect bun-to-aioli ratio. 

Before departing, Mario suggested I try a canoli too. It didn’t take much for me to acquiesce as all the deserts were very inviting. I grabbed one to share with Danielle, my partner and co-writer of this blog.

At home, we silently nodded in unison after taking a bite of the canoli. It was light, flaky and the creamy filling reminded us of amandine. We regretted not picking up another one.

Guess we’ll just have to go back to Misto Fine Food Shop for seconds.
