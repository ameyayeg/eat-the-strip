A new crêperie tucked away in a Kanata strip mall is offering a taste of Paris to Ottawa’s food scene.

Le Petit Paris - Crêpes et Compagnie Inc., opened in September 2024, is the passion project of Nene Coumba Ba, a trained chef from Paris, and Guy Bisson, her partner from Manitoba. The couple, who met on a flight returning from Paris, decided to open the takeout-only spot after Nene saw an opportunity to bring an authentic French crêpe experience to the Ottawa area.

From the moment we walked in, we were welcomed warmly by Guy, who greeted us with a smile. The small, takeout-focused space immediately evokes the charm of a Parisian café. The walls are adorned with nostalgic images of Paris, a framed picture of the Mona Lisa, and even a photo of the couple beside their city permit. This intimate atmosphere made us feel at home, and Nene and Guy’s enthusiasm for their business was infectious.

Though still in the early stages of their journey, Guy noted that the response so far has been overwhelmingly positive. "It’s been a very warm reception," he said, adding that they’re learning and growing with each day. With a five-star rating on Google, it’s clear that the community is embracing the crêperie as their own.

As we chatted with the couple, a regular customer eagerly recommended the choux au caramel, one of the shop’s most popular items. And it’s no surprise, given the steady flow of customers eagerly awaiting their turn. We couldn’t leave without trying a couple of standout crêpes.

The La new yorkaise, a savoury creation, features marinated ground beef, cheddar, pickle, salad, and tomato. The crêpe itself was delicate and soft, and the fresh basil, caramelized onions, and Dijon-style sauce blended perfectly with the melted cheese. It was a satisfying and refreshing start to our day.

For dessert, we opted for the La caramilsee, a sweet combination of Nutella and homemade salted caramel. Despite not being a fan of salted caramel, my partner and co-writer of the blog Danielle couldn’t resist the rich, oozing caramel with its rum-brandy essence. It was a decadent indulgence, though one that’s best shared—it’s rich enough to make a mess, especially when enjoyed in the car, as we did.

We paid just under $20 for both crêpes. The portions were generous and we left feeling full and content. Nene and Guy have certainly created a unique offering in Ottawa’s food scene, and with a growing base of loyal customers, it seems likely that La Crêperie Parisienne will continue to grow.

For anyone looking to experience a little taste of Paris, Le Petit Paris - Crêpes et Compagnie Inc. is a must-try. It’s not just the food, but the warmth of the owners and the authenticity of the experience that makes this spot a true hidden gem.
