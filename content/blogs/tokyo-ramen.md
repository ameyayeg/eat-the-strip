Tucked in a Skyline Acres plaza in Fredericton, wedged between a low-slung motel and a pizzeria and not far from the campuses of the University of New Brunswick and Saint Thomas University, Tokyo Ramen is the kind of place you could miss if you weren’t looking for it. But once you’ve been, it’s hard to forget. Even before you step through the door, the air smells like something good is happening inside. Broth and sizzling meat, ginger and garlic, steam and soul. The kind of smells that stick to your clothes—in the best way.

Tokyo Ramen first opened back in 2019, a quiet addition to the city’s small but mighty ramen scene. It quickly became a go-to for students, families, and homesick ex-pats looking for comfort in a bowl. But in 2024, the lights went out. After the head chef and co-owner was diagnosed with kidney failure, the restaurant shut its doors. For a while, it looked like Fredericton had lost one of its few truly authentic Japanese kitchens.

In early 2025, the owners announced they were planning to reopen. The news travelled fast among regulars and local food lovers who had missed the place. When the doors did open, it was a steady stream of customers who remembered what was here and couldn’t wait to be back.

Inside, the layout is simple but thoughtful. Four desks line one wall, like a study nook for solo diners or takeout regulars. In the back, a larger seating area includes a traditional on-the-floor setup, tucked into a slightly sunken corner of the room. One wall is papered in giant, bright photographs of the dishes, a visual menu as much as a statement of pride. This is what we make. Look at it. Order something.

You seat yourself, then head to the counter to place your order. The server who welcomed us offered a few recommendations, clearly favouring the spicy bulgogi ramen and their namesake Tokyo ramen. He wasn’t wrong. We tried both—along with a few other dishes—and came away full, impressed, and already planning a return visit.

We started with the okonomiyaki, a savoury Japanese pancake folded with shrimp and finished with a creamy, tangy sauce. It’s deeply umami, with a texture somewhere between crispy omelette and molten pancake. The shrimp were impossibly tender, almost melting into the batter, while the edges stayed golden and crisp.

Next came the tonkotsu ramen, the classic pork bone broth with chashu pork, bamboo shoots, and noodles. The broth is thick and creamy, rich without being overpowering. The pork is the star—fatty, fall-apart tender, and just the right kind of indulgent. Bamboo shoots bring a crunchy contrast, and the whole bowl feels thoughtfully constructed. If you’re new to ramen, this is the gateway.

But it was the spicy bulgogi ramen that stood out most. The broth hits with a pleasant, lingering heat—enough to warm you, but never too much. The sweetness of the bulgogi balances the spice, and the vegetables scattered generously across the top add both texture and brightness. Corn, beans, and bamboo shoots all hold their own here, and the noodles have that perfect just-chewy bite. It’s the kind of bowl that feels like a small reward after a long day, especially with the evenings starting to cool down in late August.

We sat down after our meal with Fumi Kamazuka, the restaurant’s manager and the son of the owners. The Kamazuka family moved to Fredericton after several years in the U.S., originally hailing from Gunma, Japan. Most of the family now works in the kitchen—parents, siblings, all of them bringing something personal to the space. When the restaurant had to close, they weren’t sure anyone would remember. But customers returned almost immediately when the doors reopened. Some things don’t need billboards; they just need to be missed.

Fumi mentioned that they make their noodles fresh every day, and it shows. There’s a quiet confidence in the food here—nothing flashy, nothing overworked. Just well-balanced flavours, warm service, and dishes that feel both familiar and deeply rooted. The Tokyo ramen, their signature dish, is the recommended starting point for first-timers, but it’s clear there’s no wrong choice on this menu.

Our total came to just under $50 for three dishes—solid value for scratch-made ramen and snacks, especially considering the quality and care involved. The service is efficient, friendly without being fussy, and the space manages to be both casual and welcoming. It’s the kind of restaurant that doesn’t chase trends, but quietly earns its place.

Tokyo Ramen is back, and Fredericton is better for it. Not just because the food is good—which it is—but because places like this are rare. They carry more than just recipes; they carry stories, family, resilience. And in this corner of a strip mall near a motel, that kind of heart matters.
