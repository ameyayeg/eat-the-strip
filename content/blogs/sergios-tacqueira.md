Fï»¿ew and far between are the places that come close to this authentic Mexican restaurant in Ottawa, one of the finest to order tacos. It doesn't matter what kind you like, they have something for everyone. Do you want al-pastor? You're in luck. Lengua? Today's your lucky day.

Try the horchada on a hot summer day on the patio facing Elgin Street.
