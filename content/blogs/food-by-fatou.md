You wouldn’t know it was there unless you wandered into the basement of a brown brick building just off York Street—one of those multi-use spots that looks more like a place you’d pick up a passport than a plate of food. But go down the stairs and you’ll find it: a bright, soulful space filled with Senegalese art, warm conversation, and the unmistakable aroma of something good being made with care. This is Food by Fatou, and if you’re lucky enough to stumble in, you won’t forget it.

It’s late morning on a September Saturday, and the restaurant is just coming to life. I’m met by Fatou’s brother, who greets me like I’ve been coming here for years. He lets me know she’s stepped out briefly to pick up a few ingredients and invites me to return shortly. Fifteen minutes later, I’m back, and this time Fatou herself welcomes me with a huge smile—and her brother hands me a chicken fataya, on the house. It’s a crisp, golden pastry stuffed with seasoned chicken and topped with a rich onion sauce—salty, warm, and gone in three bites. I haven’t even ordered yet and already I know I’ve found something special.

Fatou and her brother recommend the thieboudienne—Senegal’s national dish—and I follow their lead. I take a seat at one of the eight tables, just as a man walks in, mid-road trip from Newfoundland to Quebec. He lights up at the chance to order jollof rice. Sona Jobarteh plays softly from the speakers while Fatou and her brother move between two kitchens, preparing dish after dish. Around the space, Senegalese masks, murals, and potted plants give the room a lived-in, welcoming energy. Every customer is greeted with warmth and familiarity. This isn’t just a place to eat—it’s a place people come back to.

And then the thieboudienne arrives.

It’s a platter that demands respect. The fish, marinated and perfectly cooked, flakes apart with the gentlest nudge of a fork. A habanero kicks in with slow-building heat, balanced by a subtle tamarind sauce that offers just enough sweetness to round things out. Nestled alongside the rice are thick slices of yam, tender cabbage, carrots, and cassava—all of it soaking up the juices from the fish and sauce, each bite layered with flavour. There’s a complexity here that reminds me of biryani, or a good bouillabaisse—meals that tell stories and ask you to listen. You don’t rush through this. You sit with it. You savour it. You let it take you somewhere else.

The spice creeps in, slowly at first, then all at once. My eyes water, and I laugh to myself. It’s the kind of heat that makes you feel alive. Next come the jumbo shrimp—plump, deeply seasoned, and cooked to perfection. There’s something ceremonial about it all. I find myself wishing I wasn’t eating alone. This is food meant to be eaten with others, with your hands, with laughter. It’s food for a table full of friends you haven’t met yet.

Fatou tells me she opened this space in 2023, but she’s been cooking for much longer. She learned from her mother back in Samone, Senegal, and every dish she makes connects her to that past. “When I cook, I’m happy,” she says, her smile widening as she shares stories of her family and her journey. She moved to Canada in 2009 and spent years as a stay-at-home mother before launching her food business. About moving to Fredericton, she says, “At first it was difficult. Now I can’t imagine living anywhere else.”

She sources her spices from Senegal and Montreal, blending them herself to maintain the flavours she grew up with. For Fatou, staying true to her culinary heritage isn’t just about ingredients—it’s about memory, identity, and ensuring the flavours carry through in every bite.

Fredericton isn’t exactly teeming with Senegalese restaurants. But even if it were, Food by Fatou would still stand out. It’s not just the food—it’s the feeling. A sense of place. A connection to something far away but deeply present. Yes, the thieboudienne runs over $20, but there are plenty of other options under $15. And frankly, it’s worth every dollar.

Fatou isn’t just serving food. She’s representing a culture, a story, and a community that’s growing right here in the Maritimes. We’re lucky to have her.

If you haven’t been, go. Bring a friend. Order the thieboudienne. And if you’re not ready for the spice, try the jollof rice. I know I will—next time.
