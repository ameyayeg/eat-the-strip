I walked over to Vars & Java on one of those beautiful February days that feels warmer than it has any right to. The sun was out, the air deceptively mild, though we all know there are colder days ahead before spring properly settles in. Still, in Fredericton, you take those days when you can get them. Nolan and Meagan, who live just a few doors down from me, joined me for the outing. I’ve been meaning to visit for months. Living in Skyline Acres can sometimes feel like being in a bit of a café desert, so having a spot like this in walking distance is something of a godsend.

I arrived first and was greeted warmly by Irena and her daughter Julia. We recognized each other from previous visits, the kind of familiarity that already hints at the feel of the place. The café is bright and clean, with a handful of tables scattered throughout. In one corner there’s a small play area for kids, and along the walls you’ll find paintings for sale and little bits of art, including some in Polish—a nod to the owners’ heritage. A fridge sits across from the entrance, and just outside in the same strip mall is a small Middle Eastern grocery store (a lifesaver for those of us without cars, especially when fresh produce arrives on Thursdays) and a commercial samosa kitchen that also supplies Vars.

Across from the entrance is the counter, with the kitchen behind it. To the left, a glass case displays cakes, tarts and other desserts—cheesecakes lined up neatly, delicate pastries tempting you to try just one more thing. My eyes were wide. The space feels especially welcome in winter: bright, dotted with plants that give a much-needed boost of green while the world outside is still grey. The smell of coffee wafts from the counter and settles into everything.

The prices are refreshing. Paninis range from about $5 to $7.50. A latte is around $5. Desserts sit in the $4–5 range. A coffee, a panini and a slice of cake for under $20 is entirely possible here. Irena told me she wants to keep prices accessible to retain regulars. In our experience, the first year of a new food business is often the best time to visit—there’s an energy to attracting new customers, a desire to make every plate count.

Julia, a UNB student taking a gap year, and Irena opened in June 2025. It’s been eight months. “It’s been good. It’s growing. More and more people are finding out about our place,” Julia told me. They’ve been adjusting slowly, adding sandwiches as they tested the market and saw what the neighbourhood wanted. Having lived in Skyline Acres for years, running the café has allowed them to see it with new eyes. “The connecting with the neighbours has been great,” Julia said. In fact, she told me they’ve gotten to know more people in these past eight months than in the previous eight years living here. Both she and her mother have worked in service before, and they value the face-to-face interactions. “It’s a lot more personal,” she said. “It’s kind of like a mom and pop feel.”

Their story stretches further back. Originally from northeastern Poland, they later moved to England, and then immigrated to Canada in 2018—their second time starting over in a new country. They decided to leave England after Brexit, noticing a shift in attitudes towards foreigners, particularly those from Central and Eastern Europe. The café’s name is a playful nod to Poland’s capital, Warszawa (pronounced var-SHAH-vah), with “Java” added for a bit of coffee-fuelled wordplay.

Most of their customers are Canadians from a range of backgrounds, so the menu leans toward familiar North American favourites—paninis, cheesecakes, tarts—while still offering Polish treats like szarlotka. Many of their cakes are Polish, and there’s shortbread as a nod to their years in the UK. It’s a quiet weaving together of places they’ve called home.

We ordered a few things to share. The pesto panini arrived first, the bread crisp and golden, giving way to sharp, melted cheese. The pesto was garlicky and bright, the basil fresh, everything working together in that simple but satisfying way that makes you wonder why you’d order anything else. It was, simply put, great.

The traditional apple pie—szarlotka—came dusted with sugar. It wasn’t overly sweet, which I appreciated. The texture is softer than a typical North American pie, almost reminiscent of a date square, and that English translation of “apple pie” doesn’t quite capture how distinct it is from what we might expect. Having had the real deal in Poland, I can say this version holds its own.

We also tried the caramel cashew cheesecake, one of their best sellers. The chocolate element leaned slightly dark, not too rich, balanced by a creaminess that didn’t overwhelm. Nolan declared the cheesecake his favourite—though I’ll admit I’m a sucker for cheesecake in any form. Meagan, for her part, loved the apple slice but honestly liked all three things. It’s that kind of place: hard to pick just one.

When I asked about the future, Irena told me she wants to grow the business into a small, welcoming café where people can meet and spend time together, where it’s all about connecting and having a good time. The little kids’ area is part of that vision. It’s about building a community hub.

Vars & Java is exactly the kind of place this blog seeks out. Suburban landscapes aren’t always the prettiest or the most walkable. There isn’t much foot traffic. But look between the houses and strip malls and you might find gems like this—family-run spots bringing some of the best treats in Fredericton to neighbourhoods that need them most. In the middle of winter, in a bright room filled with plants and the smell of coffee, the winter blues don’t stand much of a chance.
