Tucked away in the food court of Westgate Shopping Centre on Carling Avenue, Glory Shawarma offers a simple yet satisfying taste of the Middle East, with a personal touch that will make you rethink your go-to shawarma spot.

Ahmid Mohamd, a quiet yet welcoming presence behind the counter, opened Glory Shawarma just six months ago after honing his skills at Zaky Grill and Broast for a year. His decision to strike out on his own comes from a passion for crafting the perfect shawarma, one that reflects his roots and the subtle flavours he learned to appreciate while living in Jordan.

On a typical visit, Ahmid’s grill spits tender, juicy chicken, sizzling with a crispy exterior that’s kissed by just the right amount of spice. I opted for the small chicken shawarma with a drink combo for a steal at $9—a price that feels as nostalgic as it does wallet-friendly. The meat, with its subtle hint of lemon zest, strikes a delicate balance of crispy and tender. But the real kicker? Fries tucked right into the shawarma, adding heartiness and a welcome crunch that elevates the experience to something unique.

I devoured half of my shawarma right there in the food court, the air filled with the mingling smells of fresh Thai dishes from the neighbouring stall. The other half? It made its way home to my partner, Danielle, who shared my excitement. She noted how light and fresh the shawarma felt—its lack of overwhelming garlic and sauce made each bite feel just right. The crunch of the vegetables, the perfect amount of tender chicken, and the fries tucked inside made it feel like the Goldilocks of shawarma—everything balanced in harmony.

At $7 for the small (which could easily pass for a medium), this is a shawarma that punches well above its weight, offering an unbeatable combination of flavour and value. So, if you’re looking to experience one of Ottawa's newest hidden culinary gems before prices inevitably rise, make your way to Westgate Shopping Centre. Glory Shawarma offers not just a meal, but a reminder of how simple, well-executed food can leave a lasting impression.
