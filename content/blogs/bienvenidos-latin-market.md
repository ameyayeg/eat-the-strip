We glanced at the clock and realized we’d make it to Bienvenidos Latin Market half an hour before closing if we got out of the door right away.

Around 20 minutes later we were greeted at the grocery store by manager Josie, who recommended we try a tamal mexicano, a Colombian beef empanada and a caramelized onion and cheese empanada. 

Yes, you read that correctly. Bienvenidos is one of those grocery stores that doubles as a restaurant. They have a seating area that can accommodate several families. Long-time readers know we’re big fans of grocery stores that sell prepared meals because they tend to be delicious. Bienvenidos opened in 2017 as a family-run business. In 2022, it moved to a new location in a strip mall on St. Laurent Boulevard. The owners, originally from El Salvadaor, opened the business to cater to Ottawa’s burgeoning Latin American community.\

The smell of corn wafted from the ovens as jovial Latin music played on the speakers. We took a seat next to a colourful, wall-length mural of a young woman and an older woman. Perhaps a granddaughter and her grandmother? 

Once our food was ready, Josie surprised us with a complimentary chicken empanada, which was my partner and Eat the Strip co-writer Danielle’s favourite. The mild mozzarella cheese and shredded chicken filling was amazing, while the doughy pastry was flaky and soft.

The tamale was served moist with a spicy chicken filling—true to its Mexican roots. The salsa verde, jalapeño and corn base made for an excellent appetizer that whet our appetite.

Both empanadas were delicious, but the deep-fried beef one was quite unique. The crispy, flaky dough reminded us of a Latin American samosa. Unlike some of the other empanadas, the filling contained spiced potatoes. It paired perfectly with the in-house salsa made with chopped tomato, onion, cilantro and lemon juice.

We paid just over $30 for our meal, which included an additional two empanadas and a tamale for takeout. We bid Josie goodbye knowing full well we’ll be back to try more of the delicious empanadas soon.
