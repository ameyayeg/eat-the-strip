I walk into the mall and follow the scent, letting it guide me down a hallway to an industrial-style space across from the Riverview Ford Lincoln, where two women greet me warmly. One of them, Omowale—also known as Moe—runs the place, and her friend helps out behind the counter. The room is simple but clean, a Christmas tree tucked by the entrance, a few tables lining the space, and stools along small ledges on either side. At the back, the kitchen is large but quiet; both women are behind the counter, lifting the lids off buffet-style trays to reveal sizzling curries and glistening fried rice, steam curling into the air and carrying rich, inviting aromas that make it impossible not to take notice.

Moe tells us about their Thursday menu as we decide what to order. I settle on the ofada rice despite their warning that it’s spicy, and Marc goes for the jollof rice. They laugh when I insist I’m up for the heat, and the gentle clink of pots and pans is accompanied by Christmas music, adding a curious festive backdrop to what is clearly home-cooked comfort.

The ofada rice arrives piled high on plates, smoky and fiery, with chunks of beef and tender tripe that immediately feel familiar and grounding. The beans are perfectly cooked, and the palm oil lends a nutty, rich flavour that soaks into every bite. Each mouthful is packed with warmth and depth, and despite the generous portion, I can’t stop eating. Marc’s jollof rice has a beautifully balanced BBQ-like seasoning and is clearly made with care. While both dishes are more than enough for two meals, Marc jokes that his plate could easily feed three.

Across from us, a diner has ordered jollof rice with sauce and fish—a combination we make a note to try next time. It’s clear that while the jollof is satisfying, the ofada rice steals the show.

Moe shares the story of the business, from catering for five years to opening the brick-and-mortar location in February. “We took the plunge and we have never regretted it,” she says. Her food draws African and non-African customers alike, and even staff from the nearby NB Power office stop by—not just for jollof, but for other traditional dishes like yam porridge, her favourite, made fresh on Fridays.

Originally from Lagos, Moe moved to Fredericton in 2018 through the provincial nomination program. She worked in HR and government in New Brunswick, but cooking has always been her passion. “The more people eat my food…it’s creating this kind of bond,” she says. She began her catering business during the heart of COVID, delivering meals to hotel rooms when people couldn’t go out. For her, community is paramount. “Whoever you are, try to build a strong relationship,” she says.

Her secret is attention to detail, passion, and the same care she would put into a meal at home. “We cook the way that we will cook it in our home,” she says. Looking ahead, Moe hopes to expand her delicacies to other cities in New Brunswick and eventually beyond.

Moe’s Delicacies delivers traditional Nigerian dishes that meet every expectation. The ofada rice, in particular, is a revelation, but adventurous eaters should explore the menu beyond jollof rice—even if it means sampling beef with offal. Portions are generous, flavours are bold, and the warmth of the counter is palpable. Prices sit around $35 per dish, which may be steep if you’re budget-conscious, but the story, portions, and taste more than justify the visit. We left already planning our return—especially for the yam porridge, Moe’s favourite, and ours too soon.
