Claudine’s Eatery sits on Dundonald Street in a space that immediately feels lived-in, the kind of place that’s been busy for years and plans to stay that way. We walk in to warm wooden panelling and a room that’s humming at 2 p.m. on a Saturday, every one of the dozen-plus tables spoken for.

I’m joined by Joel and Reeves. Joel, who’s been here before, is greeted like a regular, which feels right for a restaurant that clearly runs on familiarity as much as food, and it’s quickly apparent that a reservation isn’t optional here. A chalkboard menu hangs on the wall, the space stretching out further than you’d expect, somehow managing to feel large and cozy at the same time. There’s an island-style hub in the middle where servers orbit efficiently and a counter at the back framing the kitchen. I later learn this was once a gym, and the transformation into a restaurant with this much warmth is impressive in its own quiet way.

Claudine’s Eatery describes itself as East Coast comfort food, family owned and operated by a mother-and-daughter duo, and that ethos comes through almost immediately. This isn’t fast food, and it isn’t trying to be clever. It’s food that’s meant to take care of you. The restaurant moved to this south side location just before the pandemic, after years on the north side, which in hindsight sounds like terrible timing. Claudine tells me they made it through by doing a lot of takeout, including Caesars, and by leaning on a loyal customer base that didn’t disappear when things got hard.

At the table, we debate the buttermilk fried chicken benedict for a moment, but I land on the classic benedict breakfast with soft eggs and ham. I upgrade the home fries to beans, fully intending to steal from my friends’ plates when theirs arrive because the home fries look excellent. When my dish hits the table, the care is immediately obvious. The meat is deeply flavourful, the eggs spill open like golden lava, and the beans are exactly what you want them to be, sweet and salty and clearly not an afterthought. This is food made by people who want you to enjoy it. Joel and Reeves confirm that the home fries are well seasoned and doing exactly what home fries should do, and judging by how quickly their plates empty, there are no regrets at the table.

My breakfast comes in at around $20, and at Eat the Strip we care a lot about places that give you real value for your money. Claudine’s fits that bill comfortably. There are pricier items on the menu if you’re feeling indulgent, but you can also get a straightforward, satisfying breakfast for just over $15, which feels more than fair for the quality and generosity on the plate. Claudine herself stops by to chat after finishing her shift, smiling and relaxed, and tells me a bit about her path here. She’s Acadian, originally from northern New Brunswick, moved to Fredericton, worked as a waitress, and eventually decided to open a restaurant with her daughter. People ask her all the time to open locations elsewhere in the province, especially given how legendary their breakfasts have become, but she laughs it off and says she’s thinking more about eventually slowing down than expanding. Given how full the room is and how content everyone looks, it’s hard to argue with that instinct.
