Hidden within the walls of Desi Price Club, a South Asian grocery store in Ottawa's industrial landscape, Minhazuddin Ahmed has brought forth a culinary gem that embodies the authentic spirit of Bengali cuisine.

What sets Desi Takeout apart is its unwavering commitment to authenticity. Unlike many establishments that rely on commercial spice blends, Ahmed's wife crafts her own recipes from scratch, meticulously grinding spices at home. This dedication to simplicity extends to their preparation methods - notably avoiding tomatoes and nuts in favour of pure, unadulterated flavours.

The restaurant's signature fish curry (rohu) presents a masterclass in balanced flavours, with meaty, tender fish complemented by a fragrant tadka - the traditional South Asian technique of tempering spices in hot oil to release their full aromatic potential. For enthusiasts of fish skin, this dish offers an especially rewarding experience.

Their chotpoti, a traditional Bengali street food, showcases the authentic flavours of Bangladesh. This hearty snack combines boiled eggs, potatoes, and chickpeas with a spicy tamarind sauce, served with crispy puri bread. The dish exemplifies the restaurant's commitment to authentic Bengali cuisine, with each component carefully prepared to create a harmonious balance of flavours and textures. Both dishes showcase the freshness of ingredients and home-style preparation that makes each bite feel like a visit to someone's kitchen.

Both the fish curry and chotpoti are priced very reasonably, with my total coming to around $20 for both. As the restaurant's biryani specialist, Ahmed demonstrates particular care with this cornerstone dish, recently reducing its price by nearly $5 to make it more accessible to customers, with the signature chicken biryani priced at just $10.

Given the intimate nature of the operation, Ahmed strongly recommends calling ahead with orders. This small-batch approach ensures each dish receives the attention it deserves, resulting in food that tastes genuinely homemade rather than mass-produced.

While Ahmed acknowledges the typical challenges of launching a new venture, customer response has been encouraging. "Business is good," he notes, though he tempers this optimism with the realistic perspective of someone still navigating the early stages of entrepreneurship.

Like many hidden gems featured on Eat the Strip, Desi Takeout proves that sometimes the most authentic culinary experiences await discovery in unexpected locations. The combination of homemade spice blends, careful preparation methods, and family recipes makes this takeout-only establishment a valuable addition to Ottawa's South Asian dining scene.
