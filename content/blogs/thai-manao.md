I walk into Thai Manao on a Thursday just after 5 p.m., the sun already starting to dip behind the buildings that line this stretch of uptown Fredericton. The restaurant sits tucked between big chain spots in a strip mall, the kind of place you might drive past without a second thought, but the smell hits immediately when I open the door — savoury, peppery, unmistakably promising. Inside, apart from me, it looks like the owners and their family are gathered around a table beneath a TV quietly showing golf, cooking meat on a tabletop gas barbecue. The scene instantly reminds me of Korean and northeastern Chinese barbecue joints I’ve spent a lot of time in back in Ontario. The dining room itself is modest: three booths, two tables, high ceilings that hint at an industrial past, paper lanterns hanging overhead, and floor-to-ceiling blinds covering half the walls.

I’m greeted warmly by the server and, after doing a bit of online homework, I ask her what to order from the “Very Chinese Menu” section. Without hesitation, she recommends the black pepper beef, the green bean stir-fry, and the family-style tofu stir-fry. I file the last two away for future visits and order the black pepper beef. While I’m waiting, one of my professors walks in and mentions this is one of her favourite spots in town for chicken Penang curry — another mental note made. 

When the food arrives, it’s still sizzling, literally boiling hot, and I’m warned to give it a moment. I’m hungry enough that I start with small sips of water from a steel tumbler — for reasons I can’t fully explain, I love drinking from steel cups — and begin cautiously nibbling. The beef comes piled with onions and crisp bell peppers, glossy with sauce. The first bite lands exactly where you want it to: the beef is tender, the black pepper announces itself slowly, and everything works beautifully with the rice. Before long, I’m fully committed, scooping up mouthfuls of sauce with rice, appreciating the crunch of the vegetables and the freshness that comes through in every bite. It’s the kind of dish that wraps around you, especially on a winter evening, and doesn’t let go.

At some point, a couple walks in and the owner greets them with hugs, saying they haven’t seen them in forever. Watching the interaction, it’s clear that for Gina, Thai Manao has grown into something far beyond a business. It’s a place where her children have grown up, where regulars drop in not just to eat but to reconnect, a small hub of community life hidden in plain sight.

Gina tells me the restaurant opened in March 2013. It began strictly as a Thai restaurant, but she explains that the local market wasn’t familiar with authentic Thai food at the time, so to keep the doors open they expanded the menu to include Chinese dishes as well. She notes that across much of Asia, stir-frying is foundational, and with the right chef, it’s possible to do both well. She’s originally from Dongbei, a region in northeastern China known for its bold, distinctive cuisine, something we chat about briefly as she moves between tables.

“We try to make the food the way it’s supposed to be and also we do a lot of gluten free items because there are many people who are starting to have gluten issues,” she says. Every dish goes through the staff first before it ever reaches the menu, and over the years, she’s come to know many of her long-term customers by name. “I know most of my long term customers and some of them come every week and some of them come every month and this is one of their stops when they’re in town.”

Fredericton, she tells me, has been home for over 20 years now. She originally moved here from B.C. to attend UNB after arriving in Canada from China, and the small-city rhythm stuck. The restaurant even has an upstairs party room with long folding tables and karaoke, a space that’s used during Lunar New Year and other festivals, when members of Fredericton’s Chinese community gather to celebrate together.

You could easily walk next door to one of the big chains and get a meal for less. But the authentic Chinese menu at Thai Manao is the real draw here, and the truth is that quality costs money. Some of the dishes hover in the $25 to $30 range, but you’re almost guaranteed leftovers, and more importantly, you’re getting food that’s stood the test of time. I’ve always been a bit wary of pan-Asian restaurants, where trying to please everyone often leads to watered-down flavours. Thai Manao is an exception. Even with dishes spanning parts of China and Southeast Asia — and Korean barbecue on the horizon — Gina stays rooted in what she knows. The result is a place where you hear the joy in her voice as she greets regulars, feel momentarily folded into the fabric of the community, and leave with a very full, very happy belly.
