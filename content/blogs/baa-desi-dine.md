I have been wanting to feature Baa Desi Dine ever since my partner brought home a take-out anda shami burger and beef kebab wrap. 

Some folks may have heard us on Robyn Bresnahan’s This is Ottawa podcast to discuss the next quintessential Ottawa dish. While we are happy that Ottawa has been officially declared the Shawarma Capital of Canada, we believe that kebabs have officially entered the chat. 

My first shami kebab was during a visit to New Delhi, India. I had never seen a round kebab, almost the shape of a slider, but it was the texture that was immediately memorable. This texture, I later came to know, was created by combining minced lamb and yellow lentils, cooked together with ginger, garlic, onion, mint, chilies and other classic subcontinental spices, until they were soft enough to be blended. These were then made into their signature cylindrical shape, dipped in egg and fried. I just knew I had to find an equivalent in Canada.  

Baa Desi Dine granted me this wish. I have since had the anda shami burger too many times to count. With the egg on top, it is a deliciously filling combination of east meets west. The added mayo, ketchup and coleslaw gives it a nice crunch and makes it feel like I’m eating a classic burger with a desi twist—all for under $10.

Another item on the menu that I have come to love is haleem, a dish commonly eaten before or after a long day of Ramadan fasting due to its heartiness. Baa Desi Dine serves an excellent variety, so we no longer have to go through the arduous process of cooking it, which can sometimes require hours of preparation. At Baa Desi Dine, the haleem is topped with fresh ginger and a healthy helping of fried onions for some extra pop. This dish is a little spicy, so beware if you have a hard time with spice. 

Lastly, the beef kebab wrap is a great way of filling up without breaking the bank. A little kick, mellowed by the semi-sweet sauce and naan wrap, coupled by the succulence of the meat, is just a well-rounded snack or meal, depending on your hunger level. 

Ali opened this family-run restaurant in October 2023 with his wife and children and hopes to expand as the business flourishes. Their focus is on homemade food and that’s why people love it.  He recommended we try to the halwa puri next time we visit, along with many other signature dishes from his hometown of Lahore, Pakistani, that are less commonly found in Ottawa. 

If you are planning to go during peak weekend hours, be sure to make a reservation as it was packed when we tried to go when Saturday afternoon. All-in-all, Baa Desi Dine a fantastic local South Asian restaurant that we love supporting.
