I left work tonight craving Nigerian food—grilled meats, spicy curries, and pounded yams were all I could think of as I raced across the parking lot toward my car, with the temperature dropping to -13°C.

I headed south on Bank Street, crossing Hunt Club Road, and began scanning the street for my destination: Detola's Kitchen. I pulled into the strip mall’s parking lot, guided by the restaurant’s illuminated sign. The spot was just across from a Honda dealership. As I entered, a vibrant mural spanned the wall, welcoming me into the clean, colourful interior. Posters of Nigerian dishes like jollof rice adorned one wall, while photos and maps of Lagos, Nigeria’s largest city, lined the opposite wall. A television played Yoruba gospel music in the background. After placing my order for fufu and egusi, I made my way to one of the five small tables.

I had first heard about egusi from a Nigerian friend years ago, but I’ll admit—until tonight, I’d never tried it. When my meal arrived, Detola herself popped out from the kitchen, complimenting me on my choice and quipping that it would “take me directly to Africa.” I eagerly broke off pieces of the doughy fufu and scooped up the rich stew, laden with chunks of charred beef. Once I started, I couldn’t stop. The stew was a comforting blend where earthy, nutty melon seeds thickened the broth and complemented the tender beef. The dish balanced spicy heat from habanero peppers with savoury depth from stock, while bitter greens added a subtle contrast. Creamy, hearty, and deeply satisfying, it was a flavourful, vibrant staple. I appreciated that I didn’t have to specify the heat level—it was perfect as it was, a default that Detola and her team had deemed just right. But for those worried about the spice, I’m told you can adjust the heat to your liking.

The meal cost just over $20, a bit more than we typically spend, but the quality made it more than worth it. Detola’s food is unique, authentic, and perfect for this weather. Don’t just take my word for it—the constant stream of Uber Eats drivers and regulars picking up takeout speaks volumes about Detola’s Kitchen.

Detola, who previously ran a restaurant on Shillington Avenue with colleagues, opened this spot in 2023 with her children. Business has been steady, though, like many restaurateurs, she’s faced challenges with staff retention. To maintain quality and consistency, she focuses on training her team to meet the high standards customers expect. She’s especially proud of her egusi, which customers often tell her is the best in the city. This may have been our first time trying it at Eat the Strip, but I’m sure it won’t be our last.
