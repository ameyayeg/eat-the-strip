Tucked away in a strip mall in Orleans, Rayan Poissonnerie & Restaurant offers a unique seafood experience that takes you straight to the Mediterranean—no passport required.

Upon entering, you're immediately greeted by the hum of the open kitchen and a lively atmosphere filled with the sounds of sizzling seafood. A striking mural of a deep-sea world, complete with fish and a view of the The Great Pyramid of Giza, transports you to a faraway seaside city—especially welcoming during Ottawa’s cold winter months.

At Rayan, there’s no menu; instead, you walk up to the counter to choose your seafood, where the fresh offerings are on full display. The lack of decision fatigue allows you to focus on the experience, which starts with picking your fish and ends with it being cooked right before your eyes.

On my visit, I went with a bowl of salad and a generous handful of perfectly fried calamari. The salad was a refreshing combination of lettuce, tomatoes, cucumbers, cabbage, and onions. The zesty lemon and olive oil made for a tangy kick that served as the ideal appetizer before the main event.

The calamari, on the other hand, was nothing short of perfection. Crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside, the secret spice blend added a depth of flavour that was utterly satisfying. With a squeeze of lemon and a dip into the house-made tartar sauce, I was transported to my first encounter with calamari in Toronto’s Chinatown, where the crispy fried rings stole my heart. The side of tartar sauce rounded out the experience, bringing comfort to the otherwise brisk winter day.

Chef Hassan shared that the Ottawa location of Rayan Poissonnerie opened in 2015, and while the business has been successful, it’s their special spice blend that’s been key to its enduring popularity. The restaurant also has several locations in Montreal, where patrons can enjoy fresh Mediterranean-style seafood, soups, and barbecued dishes. “If you like seafood or fish, just come here and enjoy,” he says with a smile. And given the pay-by-weight pricing, it’s easy to enjoy a fulfilling meal without breaking the bank—my salad and calamari cost me just $16.

Fatima, a loyal customer who reached out to us after hearing about the restaurant, couldn’t have been more enthusiastic about Rayan’s offerings. She raved about their fried shrimp, sautéed cod, and tilapia, and like many regulars, she’s made the 30-minute drive from the south side of Ottawa just for a taste of this hidden gem.

Despite being in an unlikely spot, Rayan Poissonnerie & Restaurant offers a truly unique dining experience—one that will have you coming back for more. Whether you're a seafood lover or simply looking for something different, Rayan’s Mediterranean-style dishes are sure to impress.
