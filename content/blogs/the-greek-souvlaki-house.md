If you're craving authentic Greek flavours in a cozy, welcoming setting, look no further than The Greek Souvlaki House. This family-owned gem has been serving up delicious, home-cooked Greek classics since 2013. With its blue and white décor, reminiscent of the beautiful Greek islands, stepping inside feels like entering a warm, inviting home. It's the kind of place where regulars are greeted by name, and the smell of charbroiled meats fills the air.

The restaurant itself is small but charming, with just seven tables, making it the perfect spot for a laid-back meal. The walls are adorned with scenic photos of Greece, and there's a small counter at the front where customers can grab coffee or takeout. One of the unique features here is the tablets at each table that let you browse through the menu with photos of the dishes. This is especially handy for those unfamiliar with Greek cuisine, but don't worry—whether you're a novice or a regular, the staff is more than happy to guide you through the menu.

We started our meal with a classic Greek appetizer: the taramosalata. This creamy, tangy dip, made from salted roe, instantly transported us to the Mediterranean. It had just the right amount of saltiness, with a texture that felt smooth yet hearty. Danielle mentioned that it reminded her of being by the sea—a perfect start to our meal.

For the main course, we ordered the chicken souvlaki platter and were impressed by the freshness and flavour of the ingredients. The Greek salad was fresh and zesty, with crunchy vegetables and feta in just the right proportion. The homemade dressing added a lovely tang, and the potatoes, which were beautifully charred and crispy, rounded out the dish perfectly. The chicken was grilled to perfection—juicy on the inside, with a deliciously smoky flavour from the charred bits. The tzatziki, with its subtle dill notes, elevated the entire meal, providing a creamy contrast to the savoury chicken.

As we were enjoying our meal, we overheard a regular at the counter sharing her long-time love for the restaurant: “I’m always here,” she said. If I’m not physically here, I’m Uber Eats-ing. I always tell people it’s the best.” Her enthusiasm echoed the sentiments of many who frequent The Greek Souvlaki House for its high-quality, made-from-scratch dishes, including the moussaka and the highly recommended lentil soup, which Mike, the co-owner, insists everyone try before it’s gone for the season.

For just over $30, we had more than enough food for a satisfying meal, with plenty of leftovers to take home. Whether you're a loyal customer or a first-time visitor, The Greek Souvlaki House is a must-try for anyone looking for Greek comfort food in Ottawa. The combination of warm service, delicious food, and a cozy atmosphere make it a spot worth returning to time and time again.
