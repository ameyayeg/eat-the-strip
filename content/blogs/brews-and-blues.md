Sometimes you follow the flavour, even if it leads you off your usual path.

At Brews and Blues in Stittsville, what started as an exception to our strip mall rule ended up being a reminder of why we chase these hidden gems in the first place. Housed in a bright, inviting space that once belonged to Equator Coffee Roasters, this spot serves up warm hospitality, hearty plates, and a quiet nod to the tastes and textures of the American South—filtered through an Ottawa lens.

The gravel lot out back hints at its past life, and yes, there’s a palm reader next door if you want your fortune told after your meal. But step inside and things feel instantly grounded: clean lines, sunlit tables, and Peter Gabriel on the speakers the afternoon I drop in. It’s airy, uncluttered, and filled with a pleasant hum—even at 2:30 on a Friday.

Our server Mani tells me the place has been open since November, and that the owner, Corri, used to run a spot in Carp called the Juke Joint. “That one shut down during COVID,” he says. “But the response here’s been amazing. Everyone in the community’s been really supportive.”

They’ve kept the music alive too—with open mic nights on Wednesdays, full bands on Saturdays, and even a DJ set planned for next week. The stage sits inside, just off the main dining area, while a sprawling, dog-friendly patio out back offers plenty of breathing room (though no one’s using it today thanks to the wildfire haze).

The menu leans Southern, but doesn’t try too hard to be a replica of anything. Mani explains that Corri was inspired by several trips to New Orleans, and the food reflects that—"We’re shooting for New Orléans type of food with a little bit of a twist,” he says.

On his recommendation, I order the Cajun curry: chicken breast in a Cajun curry cream sauce, served over seasoned rice and topped with baked mozzarella and candied pecans. A side of garlic naan rounds it out. It’s rich and a bit indulgent, like butter chicken gone wandering through Louisiana. There’s real depth from the curry spice, balanced by the creamy cheese, and the pecans bring in just enough sweetness to make you pause between bites.

The beer—an Ashton session lager—is light, crisp, and cuts nicely through the richness of the dish. Altogether, it’s a satisfying plate that feels fresh and fun, and at $19 plus beer, not unreasonable for the portion and quality.

Brews and Blues may not be buried in a strip mall or hiding behind a grocery store, but it still fits the bill: it’s far enough from the city core to fly under the radar, and full of the kind of detail and care that makes a place worth discovering. The food is an hommage—not a replica—to a beloved cuisine, and the energy here is unmistakably about bringing people together around good meals and live music.

If you go on a Wednesday or Saturday, bring your appetite—and maybe your dancing shoes, too.
