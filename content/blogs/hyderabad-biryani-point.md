Between a dentist’s office and a pizza joint in a sleepy Kanata strip mall, Hyderabad Biryani Point is quietly turning out some of the best biryani in the city.

Inside, the space is simple and compact: three booths to the left, two tables to the right, and the rich smell of simmering spices already pulling us toward the counter. A photo of the Charminar, one of Hyderabad’s most iconic monument, hangs prominently on the wall. At one of the tables, a group of friends is deep into plates of dum biryani, happily tearing meat from the bone. It's a scene we’ll soon join.

My partner and co-writer of Eat the Strip Danielle and I ask what’s popular, and the answer is immediate: mutton biryani. We order one to share—plus two small raitas, just 25 cents each—and take a booth. Danielle cracks open a Diet Coke. Top 40 hits from a decade ago are playing on the stereo as the kitchen fills the room with a heady mix of cardamom, cloves, cumin, and onion.

The biryani arrives in a silver takeout tray, still steaming. The rice is long-grain and deeply aromatic, layered with soft herbs, fried onions, and whole spices. But the main event is buried within: tender, bone-in mutton that’s been slow-cooked until it practically collapses. The flavours are full and warming, balanced with just enough heat and depth. It’s rich, but not greasy. A dish made with care. And more than enough to feed two.

Scanning the menu for next time, a list of Vijayawada-style curries stands out—spicy Andhra-style dishes known for their use of green chillies, pepper, and punchy flavours. If the biryani is anything to go by, these will be worth the return trip.

After the meal, we chat with Lokesh, who opened the restaurant in March 2024 with his business partner Nagendra. Lokesh is a civil engineer by training but spent 15 years living in Hyderabad and clearly has an eye—and palate—for the details. Nagendra is a professional chef with 14 years of experience in India, the U.S., and Canada, including running a restaurant in Calgary before relocating to Ottawa. The biryani recipe is his own.

Everything is made in small batches—just two a day. No shortcuts, no reheating. Customers are asked about spice level and preferences when ordering, and it’s clear they’re interested in matching each person with a dish they’ll actually enjoy.

For us, the mutton biryani was the star: flavourful, generous, and comforting without being heavy. At over $20 for the goat, it’s on the pricier end of their menu, but well worth it. Chicken and vegetarian options come in around $15.

This is the kind of place you find once, then keep coming back to. Not just because the food is excellent—but because it tastes like someone cares about getting it right.
