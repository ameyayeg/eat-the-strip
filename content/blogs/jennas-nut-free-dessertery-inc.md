We pull into the quiet commercial pocket on Urquhart Crescent about half an hour before closing, classic form for us. It’s a warm Saturday afternoon, sun catching in the dust above the parking lot, and as soon as we step inside, the room opens up in lime green. Murals stretch across the walls in soft florals and warm yellows, the kind of artwork that immediately softens your shoulders. Isa pauses and says the mural is beautiful, pointing out the flowers and light scattered across it. The whole space feels lived-in, personal, like someone invited you into the warmest part of their home.

Inside the glass case sit a few desserts, including a brownie cheesecake we briefly mistake for a Nanaimo bar. Two small tables run along the windows where the sun pours in. Farther back, more tables and a row of stools line the wall. The menu on the wall isn’t up to date, so we grab the paper menus at our table. Most things are under fifteen dollars, and when I see the bannock breakfast sandwich, the choice is made. The Cranberries are playing, followed by that familiar strum of The Weight, and the mix of nostalgia and sunlight and lime-green paint gives the place a strange comfort, bright, airy, and somehow already familiar.

Jenna’s Nut-Free Dessertery began with just two folding tables at the Fredericton Boyce Farmers’ Market back in 2019. A few years later, they moved into this brick-and-mortar spot on Urquhart Crescent, still sourcing much of their produce from that same market. The origins feel close to the surface here, local, scrappy, and shaped by the rhythm of the community rather than the demands of a trend.

Lexi works the front, and in the kitchen is Sage, who has been here for over a year. We chat between orders, and Sage explains that the customers are what make the place special. “Out of every spot in Fredericton we have the best customers,” says Sage. “We count everyone here as family.” There’s talk of the doors Jenna has opened and the culinary opportunities that didn’t exist before. “It’s been rather awesome working here alongside all these guys.” Waffles are a favourite, and the BLT is called the most underrated item, with the burger described as a reliable choice. From the front, Lexi offers their own picks: the eggs Benedict, the chicken panini, and the gravy for the poutine.

The bannock breakfast sandwich comes out warm and buttery, the bread soft with that gentle pull bannock has when it’s been treated with care. The sausage is mildly spiced, cheesy in the right places, the flavours nesting into each other without fighting for attention. The home fries come as a surprise bonus, an add-on I don’t regret for a second, crisp edges, peppery, not burned, not drenched in salt, the kind of fries you keep picking at long after you should stop. Marc digs into his plate. Isa lets me steal a bite of their eggs Benedict, and the yolk runs down in a perfect ribbon. It’s balanced, rich, and bright, the kind of Benedict that sneaks up on you as one of the best in the city.

There’s a quiet rhythm to the room, regulars coming in from nearby offices, families dropping by, people looking for something good without driving all the way downtown. The atmosphere sinks into you slowly, clean, colourful, warm, and honest. The kind of place where you feel welcome on your first visit and like a regular on your second.

Later in the conversation, Sage describes the place as feeling like home and says they hope first-time visitors enjoy their meal at least a little. The sentiment fits the room. There is an easy warmth here, shaped not by décor or messaging but by the people working behind the counter and the regulars who keep returning.

By the time we gather our things, the light has shifted and the music has changed again, but the feeling sticks: a small, tucked-away gem in an industrial strip, built on family, community, and food made with genuine care. It’s the kind of spot where breakfast feels less like a meal and more like a gesture. Come here for the morning comfort. It’s worth it.
