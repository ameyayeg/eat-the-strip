Hidden away in a strip mall deep within an ocean of business parks, 50 Two Sandwiches & More stands in a class of its own. There’s always a line, and never a dissatisfied customer.

Outside, a lone sign hidden behind a snowbank warns those foolish enough to brave the weather and lack of sidewalks looking for a unique lunchtime treat: “WARNING: HIGHLY ADDICTIVE SANDWICHES."

Not so much a warning, but a threat. Once you’ve tried their specials, every break will be spent buying, eating or thinking about 50 Two sandwiches.

What makes them so good? The freshness of the ingredients, the freshly baked bread, the gratuitous portions and the affordable prices. Oh, and since everything is made on the spot, your order is tailor-made to your taste.

Now you’re probably wondering, is there a catch?

You betcha.

Primarily a breakfast and lunch spot, with its core diners being the starved laborers of Nepean, 50 Two Sandwiches adheres to a rather limited schedule. If you want a life-changing sandwich, you’ll have to stop by Monday to Friday, between 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. Expect a line, as these are the only times the restaurant will be open, but it is worth the wait.

So, what kind of sandwich can you expect? The kind that shuts you up for 30 minutes to an hour of unpaid lunch time.

A quick look at their menu, and you’ll see that the primary focus is on Italian-inspired sandwiches with cold cuts, varied cheeses and delightful toppings. There’s the “Eataliano” with genoa salami, capocollo, prosciutto cotto and provolone cheese; the “Fuhgeddaboudit” with hot and mild salami, hot and mild capocollo, prosciutto and Havarti cheese; and the “Godfather” with fresh mozzarella, prosciutto and roasted red peppers.

But it doesn’t just stop there. You can get a Buffalo Pollo sandwich with hot chicken breast and cheddar cheese; a classic roast beef and Swiss cheese sandwich, a tuna sandwich, a “Stuffa U Face” sandwich with literally every deli meat they have that day, topped with cheddar & provolone; and more than two dozen other sandwiches, wraps and salads.

You can make your sandwich your own by adding toppings including the classic tomato, lettuce, red onion, pickles, hot peppers as well as green olives and hot eggplant. And you get to choose your dressing as well, they have everything from plain mayo and mustard to balsamic glaze and homemade garlic sauce.

On your way out, don’t forget to pick up a half-dozen homemade cookies, you wouldn’t want to regret it later.
